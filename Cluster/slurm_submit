#! This line is a comment
#! Make sure you only have comments and #SBATCH directives between here and the end of the #SBATCH directives, or things will break
#! Name of the job:
#SBATCH -J CO2GraVISim
#! Account name for group, use SL2 for paying queue:
#SBATCH -A NEUFLED-SL3-CPU
#! Output filename:
#! %A means slurm job ID and %a means array index
#SBATCH --output=/home/ejf61/rds/hpc-work/CO2GraVISim/batch_run_test/logs/poro_current%A_%a.out
#! Errors filename:
#SBATCH --error=/home/ejf61/rds/hpc-work/CO2GraVISim/batch_run_test/logs/poro_current%A_%a.err

#! Number of nodes to be allocated for the job (for single core jobs always leave this at 1)
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#! Number of tasks. By default SLURM assumes 1 task per node and 1 CPU per task. (for single core jobs always leave this at 1)
#SBATCH --ntasks=4
#! How many many cores will be allocated per task? (for single core jobs always leave this at 1)
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1
#! Estimated runtime: hh:mm:ss (job is force-stopped after if exceeded):
#SBATCH --time=12:00:00
#! Estimated maximum memory needed (job is force-stopped if exceeded):
#! RAM is allocated in ~3380mb blocks, you are charged per block used,
#! and unused fractions of blocks will not be usable by others.
#SBATCH --mem=3380mb
#! Submit a job array with index values between 1 and n
#! NOTE: This must be a range, not a single number (i.e. specifying '32' here would only run one job, with index 32)
#! --array=1-n%m  (n is total parameter sets generated by poro_parameters.py, m is ntasks defined above (number of task running similtaneously
#SBATCH --array=1-4%4

#! This is the partition name.
#SBATCH -p icelake

#! mail alert at start, end and abortion of execution
#! emails will default to going to your email address
#! you can specify a different email address manually if needed.
#SBATCH --mail-type=ALL

#! Modify the environment seen by the application. For this example we need the default modules.
. /etc/profile.d/modules.sh                # This line enables the module command
module purge                               # Removes all modules still loaded
module load rhel8/default-icl              # REQUIRED - loads the basic environment
module load python/3.6                     # Set python3.6 as default python
source /home/ejf61/python/bin/activate

#! The variable $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID contains the array index for each job.
DIR="/home/ejf61/rds/hpc-work/CO2GraVISim/batch_run_test/"

#! In this example, each job will be passed its index, so each output file will contain a different value
echo "This is job" $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID

#! Command line that we want to run:
cd /home/ejf61/rds/hpc-work/CO2GraVISim/
